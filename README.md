#ViNA

ViNA: An open source platform integrates VoIP, CoIP, XMPP, private IP 
and telecommunications protocols. It supports calling, video calling, 
messaging and file sharing with any application. All data is encrypted.
Available under GNU AGPL v3 and commercial license.


Project Name: ViNA (Voice, Instant Messaging, Network Architecture)

Description: ViNA is an open source platform that unifies and harmonizes 
various communication protocols. It supports a wide range of applications 
for both voice and video calls, messaging and file sharing. ViNA integrates
VoIP, CoIP, private IP communication protocols, web protocols, 
telecommunication infrastructure protocols and base station protocols, 
enabling users to connect to others with any application.


ViNA: "VoIP is Not Another"
Abbreviation: VoIP is Not Another (This emphasizes that your project deals
with VoIP protocols in a different way and offers a unique solution that 
brings different systems together).

ViNA stands for Voice Interconnection Network Architecture.

This name beautifully reflects the purpose and structure of our project:

Voice: Voice communication
Interconnection: Represents the connection between different systems 
and protocols.
Network Architecture: Expresses the overall architecture of your project 
and the structure of bringing different protocols together.
In this way, ViNA became a meaningful name both as the abbreviation 
of "VoIP is Not Another" and as "Voice Interconnection Network Architecture".

Free Software (in the sense of Free from Freedom): A Free Communication project 
carried out in the name of true Freedom, to support and spread freedom of 
communication, to provide encrypted communication for personal privacy, and 
privacy to hide data from data-sucking companies and states, and to provide 
anti-anonymity (except for unusual and extraordinary circumstances) in the 
name of security and law, where we keep only the basic identity data and basic 
communication connection data of individuals encrypted
[for example, x called y at 22:22:22, talked for 22 minutes, etc.], 
only this data can be accessed with a key, all the rest is encrypted without 
a key, and can only be accessed by unlocking the key of the basic identity 
data and delivered to the legal authorities according to the provisions of 
legal institutions (if the law really works).


Usage Scenarios:
Communication Using Any Protocol: You can make calls, make video calls, video 
conference, send messages and share files between any application using any 
protocol and any application using other protocols.


Encryption: Every piece of data is encrypted to ensure secure communication. 
This covers all communications, from voice and video calls to messaging to 
file sharing.
Telecommunications and Internet Based Applications: Internet-based 
telecommunication applications can be accessed through the base stations; 
phone calls and SMS/MMS can be sent. You can also make calls, send messages 
and send pictures that comply with MMS standards from the internet-based 
telecommunication application to the base station system.


Project Objectives:
Comprehensive Communication Solutions: Providing a comprehensive communication 
solution by combining different communication protocols.
Open Source Contribution: Creating a project that is continuously developed and
improved with community contributions.
Commercial Use: Reaching a wide user base by offering professional support and 
integration services under a commercial license.

Web and Mobile Applications: You can make voice and video calls using WebRTC 
and other protocols.
Messaging and File Sharing: Messaging and file sharing can be done through any 
communication application.
Making Calls: Video calls or non-video calls can be made through any 
communication application.
Conference Organizing: All kinds of official, private institutions/organizations, 
legal entities and individuals can organize conferences and participate in 
conferences; participate in webinars, organize meetings, to 


Cross-Device Telecommunications: Web Applications, Browsers, Web-based 
applications, Apple brand Mac, iPad, iPhone, watch devices, desktop and mobile 
devices using Windows OS, PCs, smartphones, tablet PCs, android and Replicant 
smartphones, android-based Fairphone, Nitrophone, Murema devices; android custom 
ROM devices such as /e/, divest, calyxOS, GNU/Linux Libre devices with Free 
Distributions, non-mobile devices with GNU/Linux distributions, GNU/Linux 
smartphones such as Librem5, Pinephone and Maemo, PlasmaMobile smartphones; in 
short, we will offer a platform that will run on existing telecommunication 
applications/packages/programs running on all mobile and desktop devices (except 
IoT, server and embedded system devices).

We will support Open Hardware devices and all open hardware. We will support 
devices with RISC-V operating system and arm architecture processors. Supports 
Rockchip, Intel, AMD, Arm, Qualcomm, Snapdragon, Mediatek, Apple, Exynos, Tensor 
processors. Supports x86_64 devices. Also supports devices with other popular 
architecture processors. Supports Pinebook and PineTab.


Inter-OS Compatible Communication: Supports all mobile and desktop operating 
systems. All Free(dom) GNU/Linux Libre Distributions(Guix OS, Trisquel OS, 
PureOS, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre, Dragora 
GNU/Linux-libre, Dyne:bolic, Ututo S and BLAG Linux and GNU OS) , all 
GNU/Linux Distributions, GNU/Linux mobile device OSs, Windows 8,10,11 and 
mobile OSs, All Apple device OSs, Android OS and Android based OSs, Replicant OS,
SailfishOS, CalyxOS, Divest OS, /e/ OS, LineageOS, Graphane OS, LibreJS supported 
browsers, postmarketOS plasma-mobile with fedora,Kupfer, openSuse OSs vs GNU/Linux
phone OSs, PureOS, KDE Neon, LuneOS, Mobian OS,GrapheneOS, ArchLinux Arm, Manjaro 
Arm.


Our goal: Free Communication. To develop a platform where all communication 
protocols can communicate with each other, recognize each other, and allow data 
exchange and transmission with each other. In this way, for example; when we make
a video call withVoIP using the SIP protocol, we will be able to answer via Zoom 
with the WebRTC protocol. In other words, our goal is to develop an internet 
communication platform where everyone can easily communicate with everyone, 
independent of the operating system, application and protocol.


Effective Communication Between Applications: In all the Operating Systems we 
mentioned; we will connect all applications that can be installed from application
stores, downloaded and installed from websites, compiled with package and source 
files, compiled with package managers, can run in isolated environments such as 
flatpak appimage, can run in isolated environments with containers such as nix, guix, 
can run in containers, all portable versions; embedded applications, closed source
applicationssuch as WhatsApp, open source applications, open source packages, free 
software; web applications, browsers, web-based applications (e.g. zoom, slack etc.); 
encrypted audio-video communication, encrypted messaging and file transfer functions
to a single data network.

At the same time, we will integrate the base station and telecommunication 
applications called "telephone*", which are the applications that can be used to 
make calls on smartphones, and the SMS/MMS applications called "message*" into the 
system. (Since this stage requires the approval of telecommunication service providers 
and official government institutions, we do not guarantee this.) Our aim is to create 
a common platformthat will provide compatibility with other protocols and perform 
data transfer by using the protocols supported by the application/package/program.
